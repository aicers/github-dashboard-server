## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added new statistics to GraphQL API `issueStat` query. A field
  `resolvedIssueCount` is added, indicating the number of resolved issues.
  Currently, an issue is defined to be resolved if and only if (1) it is
  "Closed" and (2) status of project item "to-do list" is "Done".
- Tracing with a filter set by `RUST_LOG` environment variable.
- Added support for passing the SSH passphrase through the `SSH_PASSPHRASE`
  environment variable.
- Added new GraphQL API: `issueStat` query. Users can filter issues by
  `assignee`, `author`, `repo`(repository name), `begin` and `end` (creation
  date range). The query returns the `openIssueCount` field, indicating the
  number of open issues.
- Added additional fields to the `issues` GraphQL query, providing detailed
  information such as comments, labels, related sub-issues, linked pull
  requests, issue descriptions, timestamps, and project-related metadata.
- Exposed a new `discussions` query in the serverâ€™s GraphQL API to query the
  stored discussion data.
- Added new fields to the `PullRequests` GraphQL query and corresponding fields
  to the `api::pull_request::PullRequest` struct.
- Added a new GraphQL API: `discussionStat` query, allowing users to filter
  discussions by `author`, `repo` (repository name), `begin`, and `end`
  (creation date range). The query returns the following fields:
  - `totalCount`: The total number of discussions.
  - `commentCount`: The total number of comments across all discussions.
- Added a new GraphQL API: `pullRequestStat` query, allowing users to filter
  pull requests by `author`, `repo` (repository name), `begin`, and `end`
  (creation date range). The query returns the following fields:
  - `openPrCount`: The number of open pull requests.
  - `mergedPrCount`: The number of merged pull requests.
  - `avgReviewCommentCount`: The average number of reviews and comments per
    merged pull request.

### Changed

- Configuration key `db_name` has been renamed to `db_path`.
- GraphQL API `issues` and `pullRequests` return 100 items if neither `first`
  nor `last` is specified.
- GraphQL API `issues` and `pullRequests` return an error if conflicting
  pagination arguments (e.g., `first` and `before`) are provided simultaneously.
- Replaced file-based config loading with the `config` crate.
- Config file must now be specified with `-c <CONFIG_PATH>`.
- `--key` and `--cert` are now required as CLI options instead of being set in
  the config file.

### Fixed

- Returns an error instead of an issue or pull request with "No title" as the
  title when the issue database contains an invalid key.
- No longer panics when the database contains an invalid value.
- Changed to always collect issues from `GitHubIssueResponse`, regardless of `has_next_page`.
