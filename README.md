[[repositories]]
owner = "aicers"
name = "github-dashboard-server"

[[repositories]]
owner = "aicers"
name = "github-dashboard-client"

[certification]
token = "github_token_info"
ssh = ".ssh/id_ed25519"

[database]
db_path = "github-dashboard"
```

- `address`: IP address and port the web server listens on. (Default:
  127.0.0.1:8000)

- `token`: A Github fine-grained [personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-token).
